# Annotated output from Pizza Makefile worksheet in Week 5
# Any line starter with # is comments on the output

# Makefile
reid@wolf:~/csc209/w5$ cat makefile
dinner: pizza salad

pizza: cheese topping.peppers
	echo making pizza
	cat cheese topping.peppers > pizza

cheese:
	echo gooey cheese > cheese

topping.%:
	echo yummy $@ > $@

salad:
	echo salad is healthy

# Starting contents for current working directory
reid@wolf:~/csc209/w5$ ls
cheese	makefile  

# The salad target is not a file so the actions are executed
# Note that make prints the action before it executes it.
reid@wolf:~/csc209/w5$ make salad
echo salad is healthy
salad is healthy

reid@wolf:~/csc209/w5$ make pizza
# Step 1: Evaluate prerequisites
#      - First prerequisite is cheese, so look for a rule where the target
#      matches cheese. 
#           - The cheese rule has no prereqs and the file cheese exists so
#           no actions are executed.
#      - Second prerequiste is topping.peppers which matches the pattern rule
#      with target topping.%
#           - The target is now topping.peppers. This rule has no prerequisites
#           and the file topping.peppers does not exist so the action is
#           executed
echo yummy topping.peppers > topping.peppers
echo making pizza
# Step 2: Now that we have evaluated and updated all the prequisites for pizza,
# have any prerequisites been modified more recently than the file pizza?
#     - The file pizza does not exist, so all prerequisites are newer than the
#     target, so we execute the actions for the rule pizza
making pizza
cat cheese topping.peppers > pizza

# Here is the contents of all of the relevant files:
reid@wolf:~/csc209/w5$ cat topping.peppers 
yummy topping.peppers
reid@wolf:~/csc209/w5$ cat cheese
Cheese... my archenemy.
So good, yet so bad.
How can I escape thee?
